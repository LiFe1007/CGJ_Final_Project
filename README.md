This project aimed to create a marble table with a tennis ball on top.  
The Phong lighting model was implemented in both the ball and the table for a more realistic scene. Besides that, for a realistic marble table, I created procedural noise using the Perlin Noise for its texture. 
Also, the application has some functionalities like an orbiting camera with zoom in/out, a saving and loading option, and the possibility of moving an object in the scene after selecting it (moving it along with its childrenâ€™s objects).
